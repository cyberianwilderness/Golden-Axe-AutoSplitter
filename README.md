# Golden-Axe-AutoSplitter
Autospliiter script for Golden Axe (SEGA Mega Drive/Genesis Version)

> [!tip] Note for speedrunners
> The rules on the leaderboard include a clear start and end frame
> - Start Frame is the first frame the two characters disappear that you are not using in the character select
> - End Frame is the first frame when you deal the final attack to the final enemy in each category of the game

> As I cannot find a variable that changes on those exact frames I have calculated the difference between the end time my autosplitter provides and the time taken using the frame count method.
> This means runs won't start on 0.000 to make up for the difference in timings
> For my autosplitter to work, you will need to use my splits, or have splits totalling the same amount as I do. For Arcade mode I used the thieves split to help split consistently, in beginner mode this was not the case
>Therefore
> Beginner Category: Starts at `-1.329` [Arcade Livesplit File](/Split-Files/Golden%20Axe%20-%20Arcade.lss)
> Arcade Category: Starts at `-6.268` [Beginner](/Split-Files/Golden%20Axe%20-%20Beginner.lss)
> Duel Category: Starts at `2.752` [Duel](/Split-Files/Golden%20Axe%20-%20The%20Duel.lss)


# Setup Guidance
For this script to work you will need
- [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/downloads/)
- [ASL Var Viewer](https://github.com/hawkerm/LiveSplit.ASLVarViewer)
- Kega Fusion 3.64 Emulator
- The game itself!

# Configuring your livesplit
Assuming you have Livesplit, ASL Var Viewer and Kega Fusion all downloaded and working. 
Insert the ASL Var Viewer into the components folder of Livesplit. 
Create your own splits or download them from the [Split-Files folder](/Split-Files/). 
- [Arcade](/Split-Files/Golden%20Axe%20-%20Arcade.lss)
- [Beginner](/Split-Files/Golden%20Axe%20-%20Beginner.lss)
- [Duel](/Split-Files/Golden%20Axe%20-%20The%20Duel.lss)

Note: The Sega CD and beginner Co-Op categories have not been tested with autosplitters, but Beginner splits should work with Beginner Co-Op.

---

> [!TIP]
> Once you have selected it, Livesplit's interface will change  
> You should have the option to select the game mode you are running  
> Arcade mode will be checked by default, as this has the most speedruns and is the most popular category to play  
> If you select more than one option, it will default to Arcade mode (The top option is their for advice)

---

> [!TIP]

> ![Accessing ASL Var Variables](/Images/edit-layout-interface.png)  

---

> [!WARNING]
> In order to access the variables drop down menu, the game must be running. If the game is not running, it will be greyed out.

> [!TIP]
> If it has been successful, your splits should like similar to the following (depending on the category you are playing!).

> [!NOTE]
> # Why bother with the RTA timer?  
> RTA = **R**eal **T**ime **A**ttack (Basically, how long it takes you to complete the game from the first input to the final input in one sitting)  
> Just to clarify, *it isn't required*.  
> It allows you to accurately time your speedruns, as the livesplit default splitter is not guaranteed to be accurate (when compared to frame counting) and cannot display times down to the thousandths, which you are asked to provide when submitting a run to the [leaderboard](https://www.speedrun.com/golden_axe).
